## Question 1
1. The statement in set notation means for any y belongs to rational numbers, there is an absolute value of y smaller than y.
2. The statement is false. For example there is a positive number like 5 belongs to rational numbers but its  absolute value is 5 itself which equals 5 but not smaller.
## Question 2
* (a) The domain of *g* is $(-1,5)$.
* (b) It is. As the graph shows the function has 2 dots at 3 but only the upper dot is solid which means the value of g when $x=3$ is 4.
* (c) The expression of *g* on domain $[1,5)$ is $$f = 
\begin{cases}
\frac12(x-1)^2+2,&x\in[1,3]\\
\frac12x+\frac72,&x\in(3,5)
\end{cases}$$  
Then we channge the places of $x$ and  $f$, then we can plot the graph of $f^{-1}$ in Jupyterbook:

## Question 3
* (a) $A\backslash\Z=\{\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{2},\pi\} $ 
* (b) $A\cap B=\{0,\frac{1}{4},\frac{3}{2}\}$
## Question 4
* To find $h^{-1}(x)$, we just switch all instances of $x$ and $h(x)$, which is
<div style="text-align: center;">

$x=\frac{h^{-1}(x)+3}{2}$

$h^{-1}(x)=2x-3$ 
</div>

* The domain of $h(x)$ is $[1,+\infty)$, which indicates the range of $h(x)$ is $[2,+\infty)$. As the concept of inverse functions we can learn the domain of $h^{-1}(x)$ is the ranger of $h(x)$, which is $[2,+\infty)$.
