## Question 1
1. The statement in set notation means for any y belongs to rational numbers, there is an absolute value of y smaller than y.
2. The statement is, of course, false. For example there is a positive number like 5 belongs to rational numbers but its  absolute value is 5 itself which equals 5 but not smaller.

## Question 2
* (a) The domain of *g* is $(-1,5)$.
* (b) It is. As the graph shows the function has 2 dots at 3 but only the upper dot is solid which means the value of g when $x=3$ is 4.
* (c) The expression of *g* on domain $[1,5)$ is $$f(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac12(x-1)^2+2,&x\in[1,3]\\
\frac12x+\frac72,&x\in(3,5)
\end{cases}$$  
Then we channge the places of $x$ and  $f(x)$  and then we can plot the graph of $f^{-1}(x)$ in Jupyterbook.
